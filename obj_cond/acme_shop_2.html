    <p>Dear participant,<br>
      For the next 20 minutes you will play the role of an employee assigned to the online sales of a computer products store. <br>
      <strong>Your job is totake care of a single phase of the entire sales process: </em>the fulfillment of order.</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>You will receive a series of orders and for each of them you will have to select from a list only those products whose summed costs will be as close as possible to the total amount that the customer wants to spend. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Being a simulation of a real job, <strong>try to identify yourself in the role and to follow the required work pace.</strong> For each order, indeed, you will have 30 seconds, then the program will automatically pass to the next order. Do not worry, for the first orders you will have more time to familiarize yourself with the system.<br>
      <br>
      If it takes less time for you to finish an order, however, you will still have to wait for the expiration of the seconds before the system automatically redirects you to the next task. </p>
    <p>Try to be as accurate and precise as possible in carrying out your role following the required work pace.<br>
      <br>
