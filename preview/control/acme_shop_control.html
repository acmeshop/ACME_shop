        <p>Dear friend, in the next twenty minutes you will be asked to test a very basic video game. We'll need the test for a later study. Basically, you'll be our beta tester! You'll have to check if the program has some bugs. To do so, just play with it!</p>


<p>This software is under test<strong>  thus some levels will be loaded several times and each game can last up to 2 minutes, for a total of 10 trials</strong>.
